  <h1>Would you like a tour?</h1>
  <p>I can explain some of the terms we use here that might be unfamiliar.</p>
  <p>
    I can also show you the different pages in the app and what they're each
    used for!
  </p>
  <p>And you can always take the tour later if you're in a hurry now.</p>
  <p>What do you say?</p>
