      <h2>Beta Releases</h2>
      <h3>2.0.0</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Production version of the site is now available at
          <a href="gravitate.zarinloosli.com">gravitate.zarinloosli.com</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thank you to everyone who installed the Gravitate beta! I wanted to
        briefly explain why I'm calling this a "beta":
      </p>
      <p>
        This version of Gravitate should be complete and relatively bug-free. As
        you can see below, I've put a lot of work into patching bugs, as well as
        creating the features necessary for the app to be usable in its current
        state.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we are still a long way from what I would consider "finished."
        Everything from small tweaks to whole new features.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm opening this to public beta for two reasons: first, I'm proud of the
        work I've done here and want to be able to use it with my friends and
        family! And second, now that the app's feature set is ready for the
        real-world, I want to make sure it works in the real world before I go
        building anything new.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please submit bugs and ideas for new features using the form in the
        settings page. I'm excited to see what this will become!
      </p>
